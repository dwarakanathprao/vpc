# About instance storage
{: #instance-storage}

Instance storage is a set of one or more solid state drives directly attached to your virtual server instance when the instance is provisioned. An instance storage disk provides fast, affordable, temporary storage to improve the performance of cloud native workloads with scratch space, caching buffers, or a place for replicated data. The data stored on instance storage is ephemeral, meaning it is tied directly to the lifecycle of the instance. The instance storage disk is automatically created and destroyed with the instance. Instance storage data is not lost, however, when an instance is rebooted.

Instance storage is a complimentary storage technology to the boot and block storage volumes for data offered with VPC. Some examples of use cases for instance storage disks are:
*	Distributed File Systems: Technologies such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which do triplication of the data across multiple servers. These technologies can improve read bandwidth and retain reliability by maintaining multiple copies of the data. It is recommended that at least three copies of the data, ideally across availability zones, are maintained when using Instance Storage for these workloads.
*	Transactional jobs: Transaction processing usually creates a significant amount of temporary files. Instance Storage is a great place to temporarily store that data while the transactions are processed, with the result stored persistently on a data  volume.
*	Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Improve performance for large geographically distributed applications with instance storage for fast, low cost, local data caching.

## Lifecycle of instance storage
The lifecycle of instance storage is critical to understand. Without a proper understanding of its temporary nature, workloads could experience data loss.
{:important}

The instance storage space is allocated and attached to the virtual server instance at the time of provisioning. It is an integral and inseparable element of the virtual server instance. If you reboot your instance (either from its operating system or through an IBM Cloud management interface), the instance storage data is retained and the instance is reconnected to its original disks.

However, when an instance is stopped or shut down, the data is cryptographically erased and the disks that were attached to the virtual server are no longer available. For auditing purposes, when an instance that has one or more storage disks is shut down, an IBM Cloud Activity Tracker event is published for each disk indicating it was "wiped". The event action is `is.instance.disk.wipe`. Refer to the Compute Events table on the [Activity Tracker page](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-at-events#events-compute) for listing of such events.

In the event of a Host Failure, the data on the instance storage disk is lost. The instance is restarted on another host automatically, but the provisioned disks are empty. In rare cases, a physical disk error might occur. If this situation occurs, the instance fails to read/write to the failed disk. The instance is not automatically restarted in this scenario. You can stop and then start your instance to effectively place it on a different disk that is functional.

Virtual servers deployed with instance storage across multiple disks (for example, bx2d-64x128 has 2 disks of 1200 GB each for a total instance storage of 2400 GB) might have a redundancy solution built in. If you are placing data on instance storage that must be reliable, then you must pair it with a solution like data replication, a distributed file system, backup to data volumes, or Cloud Object Storage. Failures might occur in the underlying storage. Make sure that your application is able to manage that use case.

Data volumes of block storage and instance storage are complimentary. Volumes can be attached to instances that have instance storage. In fact, instances that use instance storage are generally attached to extra data volumes for the persistent storage requirements of that workload.

## Encryption and isolation
{: #encryption-isolation}

Instance storage data is secured with on-disk encryption. The physical disks used for instance storage are self-encrypting with the strong AES-256 encryption standard. The data is automatically decrypted when your instance accesses the data. When your instance is shut down or deleted, the underlying storage space is cryptographically erased and deleted. At that point, the data is unrecoverable. For more information, see [Introduction to encryption](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-basics).

Data is automatically encrypted on the physical media at the drive level. For sensitive data, it is strongly recommended that users utilize software-based file system encryption such as LUKS for Linux&reg; or BitLocker for Windows&reg;. This technology allows end users to encrypt entirely within the instance, and can provide additional protection for sensitive data. Some operating systems also provide FIPS certified encryption algorithms that may also be used. See [Encrypting block devices using LUKS](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/encrypting-block-devices-using-luks_security-hardening) for an example of how to encrypt on Red Hat Enterprise Linux&reg; however, refer to the Operating System documentation or specific information on how to encrypt each device.

## Isolation
{: #isolation-instance-storage}

The instance storage disk, or disks attached to the virtual server instance, cannot be shared with any other virtual servers and cannot be accessed by any other virtual servers in the future. They are one-time use, single-attach, for the virtual server that requested the instance storage. There is also isolation from negative performance effects of different virtual servers doing I/O to different portions of the same physical device (as described in the next section). 

## Performance
{: #performance-instance-storage}

Instance storage is rate-limited. If the instance storage allocated to the virtual server instance is smaller than the entire physical Solid State Disk (SSD), then I/O bandwidth and IOPS limits are put in place proportional to the size of the attached disk. This limitation is in place to prevent a busy instance from consuming more than their fair share of the bandwidth of the device (noisy neighbor).

## Multiple instance storage disks
{: #multiple-instance-storage-disks}

When there are multiple instance disks on your virtual server instance, each disk is provisioned from a separate underlying physical device. This allows for better independent performance as well as software high-availability solutions to be implemented like software-based RAID.
Make sure to review the Life Cycle section to understand when data loss may occur.

## Billing
{: #billing-instance-storage}

You are billed for instance storage only while the virtual server instance is running.

## Restrictions
{: #restrictions-instance-storage}

Using instance storage comes with some restrictions. Keep the following in mind when you are considering instance storage:
*	You cannot attach or detach the instance storage disk from an existing virtual server instance.
*	The instance storage disk cannot be used as a boot disk.
*	Bring your own key (BYOK) is not supported for instance storage.

Review the Lifecycle of instance section to understand the data retention policy differences between instance storage and volumes.
